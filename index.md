## Hello there, looks like I have a visitor today

 “Data! data! data!”, Sherlock cried impatiently. “I cannot make bricks without clay.” -Arthur Conan Doyle

Why Data Science, you ask? Cause I can be Sherlock 🔍 in the data universe. I find it interesting to solve problems. I am driven by intellectual curiosity to demystify underlying patterns, insights and innovate something out of data. Well, my love for data and fiction has to be blamed for such surreal analogy.

With 4 years of industry experience, I bring with me the competence to help leverage machine learning algorithms to solve business problems. I have been involved with various Machine Learning algorithms, Classical Computer Vision techniques, Sequence Models (NLP), and advanced data analysis.
